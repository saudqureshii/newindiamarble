                <h1> Rainforest Gold Marble Bidasar Marble's </h1>
               <p>Bidasar Marble Mines :
                is located in the remote dessert of Bidasar Tehsil-in the Sleepy village of Dunkar.
                
                we are the Pioneers to first discover the marble, which was agricultural land, the owners would harvest Millets etc.
                while we were visiting for some personal work.
                
                we see raw stone lying every where, the villagers didnt realise it has qualities of marble
                
                we took samples to Bomaby and there we cut the raw stone and saw some very nice unique veins in the Brown and Golden color marble
                that gave us motivation to invest in the marble which was not known to the world.
                
                we introduced it to the marble market,but unfortunately the traders didnt belive this was real marble, they challenged to us that it was artificial marble
                created in some factory.
                
                it was hard to make the traders  belive this is real marble, it took us many years to convince the marble factory owners who are the one who would eventually
                cut the blocks into sheets.it was very long process and totally different treatment to get the best out of the marble duarability and lasting shining.
                
                untill recently our mines production was 100 % exported to China and the processed marble they re-exported to USA and Europe and Arab world.
                unfortunately the business conflict with india and china have taken toll on our mines too.
                
                we are now all geared up to export and make avaliable to the local market the best quality of marble with reasonalbe price 
                
                buyers are welcome to visit our mines for inspection.
                
                Tentative block sizes avaliable are 8' x 4' and above,  approximate weight 20 tons and above of each block.</p>
